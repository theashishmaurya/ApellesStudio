/**
 * @chroma/motion — pure manifest read/write logic for the Inspector (D-099,
 * Phase 2 of `docs/notes/global-inspector.md`).
 *
 * D-151 adds `addLayer`, the first op here that *creates* rather than
 * reads-or-sets — the insert path behind the Catalog panel
 * (`CatalogPanel.tsx`), scoped off `docs/notes/motion-tab-audit.md`'s
 * finding that this package could edit everything and create nothing.
 *
 * Kept separate from `InspectorPanel.tsx` so the actual editing logic is
 * testable without rendering React. Every `set*` function returns a NEW
 * `Manifest` (immutable, `structuredClone`-based) — the caller
 * (`InspectorPanel`) serializes it back to JSON text and hands it to
 * `useMotionManifest`'s `setText`, the same single source of truth
 * `ManifestEditor.tsx`'s raw-JSON textarea already writes through. This file
 * never touches component state directly.
 *
 * A layer is `.passthrough()` in the zod schema (D-046) — per-primitive
 * fields aren't statically typed on `Layer`, so every read/write here goes
 * through `Record<string, unknown>`, the same cast `LayerList.tsx`'s
 * `layerLabel` already uses.

/**
 * Insert a new primitive into a scene, and say where it landed (D-151).
 *
 * The one *creative* manifest op in this file — every other export above
 * either reads, or writes a field on something that already exists. Before
 * this, nothing in the whole package could make a layer exist except typing
 * JSON into `ManifestEditor.tsx`'s textarea; that was the biggest single gap
 * `docs/notes/motion-tab-audit.md` found.
 *
 * Placement is decided by the catalog, not the caller: a `in3d` primitive is
 * a three.js object and only means anything under `<Scene3D>`, so it goes
 * into `scene.scene3d.children` — creating the `scene3d` container (with the
 * minimum valid camera, since `cam3dKey[]` is `.min(1)`) if the scene has
 * none. A 2D primitive goes into `scene.layers`, likewise created if absent.
 * Appending, not inserting mid-array, because a manifest layer's paint order
 * IS its array order and appending is the only position with no opinion
 * about what should sit on top of what.
 *
 * Returns the new `Manifest` *and* the `Selection` pointing at what was just
 * added, so the caller can select it immediately — the Inspector then shows
 * its fields with no second click, which is the difference between "a layer
 * appeared somewhere" and "here is your new layer, edit it." Returning a
 * bare `Manifest` like the `set*` functions would throw that index away and
 * force the caller to re-derive it.
 *
 * Out-of-range `sceneIndex` is a no-op returning `selection: null` — the
 * same defensive floor every function above holds, since the raw-JSON
 * textarea can shrink the manifest under a stale selection at any time.
