# CHANGELOG

One or two lines per session. Detail lives in the decision it references.

## [Unreleased]

- **2026-09-01** — Repo scaffolded. `engine/` submodule = RapidRAW. Docs written (vision,
  PRD, scope, architecture, roadmap, research, grade-format, MCP surface, decisions).
  `CLAUDE.md` rules.
- **2026-09-01** — Engine code-read (`docs/09`). Rust 1.98, `cargo check` passes.
  Findings that shaped decisions: AI is ONNX-in-Rust not Python (**D-009**); `WgpuDisplay`
  is the native video-surface path (**D-006**); render core is Tauri-coupled → extract
  `render_core` (**D-014**). Added D-012 (SAM 1→2), D-013 (relight → v3).
- **2026-09-01** — ffmpeg → 4K Rec709 frame from the C019 test take works. Disk cleaned
  (3.6 → 38 GiB free).
- **2026-09-01** — D-003 decided (standalone hard fork; still keep changes clean for
  upstream cherry-picks), D-012 decided (SAM 2, no fallback).
- **2026-09-01** — App builds + launches (`tauri dev`, 7m18s). Phase 0 done.
  Phase 1 started: `src/chroma/video.rs` — ffmpeg probe + single-frame decode (D-015),
  first engine divergence (all under `src/chroma/`, +1 line in `lib.rs`). Tests pass
  against the real C019 4K take.

## Releases

_(none — pre-v1)_

- **2026-09-01** — Minimal video-open path built: a video loads as frame 0 through the
  existing grade pipeline (`src/chroma/{state,load}.rs` + 3 one-line hooks). Engine on
  branch `chroma`. App rebuilt + running.
