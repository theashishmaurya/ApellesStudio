# CHANGELOG

One or two lines per session. Detail lives in the decision it references.

## [Unreleased]

- **2026-09-01** — Repo scaffolded. `engine/` submodule = RapidRAW. Docs written (vision,
  PRD, scope, architecture, roadmap, research, grade-format, MCP surface, decisions).
  `CLAUDE.md` rules.
- **2026-09-01** — Engine code-read (`docs/09`). Rust 1.98, `cargo check` passes.
  Findings that shaped decisions: AI is ONNX-in-Rust not Python (**D-009**); `WgpuDisplay`
  is the native video-surface path (**D-006**); render core is Tauri-coupled → extract
  `render_core` (**D-014**). Added D-012 (SAM 1→2), D-013 (relight → v3).
- **2026-09-01** — ffmpeg → 4K Rec709 frame from the C019 test take works. Disk cleaned
  (3.6 → 38 GiB free).
